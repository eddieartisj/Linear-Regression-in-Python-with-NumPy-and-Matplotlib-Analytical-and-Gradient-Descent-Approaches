# Linear-Regression-in-Python-with-NumPy-and-Matplotlib-Analytical-and-Gradient-Descent-Approaches
A complete implementation of simple linear regression using both the analytical (closed-form) method and gradient descent, built as part of Purdue University’s Machine Learning Foundations course. Includes gradient descent visualization, learning-rate comparison, and fully annotated Python code.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning Foundations course in Purdue University’s Cybersecurity Workforce Certification Training Program.
The purpose of this lab was to explore the fundamentals of linear regression, implement it using two approaches, and understand how learning rates influence the gradient descent optimization process.

## 📋 Topics Covered

## Tasks Completed

### **✔ Task 1**: Analytical Method of Linear Regression

Generated synthetic linear data

Computed mean values of X and y

Calculated line of best fit using closed-form formulas

Plotted equation on top of the dataset

### **✔ Task 2**: Gradient Descent Method

Implemented a custom cost function

Built gradient descent algorithm from scratch

Tracked parameter updates (θ₀ and θ₁)

Visualized cost reduction over time

### **✔ Task 3**: Learning Rate Comparison

Created a function to illustrate convergence behavior

Evaluated multiple learning rates (0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1)

Compared regression line adjustments and cost curves

Observed underfitting, stable learning, and divergence patterns

## 📷 Visual Outputs

The notebook generates several plots, including:

- Scatter Plot of Synthetic Data

- Best-Fit Line (Analytical Method)

- Cost Function Plot (Gradient Descent)

- Learning Rate Comparison Grid

- Shows regression line progression

- Displays cost curve for each learning rate

All visuals are produced directly when running the notebook cells.
